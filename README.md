# CS-499 ePortfolio – Merrik Wright

This repository hosts my Computer Science Capstone ePortfolio for **CS-499**.  
It demonstrates my growth across **software design and engineering**, **algorithms and data structures**, **databases**, and **security**, while also showing professional communication and user-experience design.

The ePortfolio is published via **GitHub Pages** at:  
  [hearin1.github.io](https://hearin1.github.io/)

## Project Components

This portfolio contains the required deliverables as outlined in the  
[CS 499 Final Project Guidelines and Rubric][guidelines]:

1. **Professional Self-Assessment**  
   A reflective narrative introducing me, my technical strengths, and how my artifacts support employability in computer science.

2. **Informal Code Review (Video)**  
   - Walkthrough of original artifact functionality  
   - Code analysis: structure, security, documentation, testing  
   - Planned enhancements mapped to course outcomes  

   Reviewed against the **CS 499 Code Review Checklist**:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.

3. **Artifacts (Enhanced Projects)**  
   - **TRAVLR Full-Stack Application**  
     - *Software Design & Engineering*: encryption utility, modular account settings  
     - *Algorithms & Data Structures*: secure authentication flow, validation logic  
     - *Databases*: MongoDB schema updates, CRUD settings, indexes  

   Each artifact page includes:
   - Overview and justification for inclusion  
   - Explanation of enhancements and demonstrated skills  
   - Reflection on challenges and lessons learned  
   - Mapping to course outcomes

##  Course Outcomes Addressed

This project demonstrates:

- **Collaboration & Communication** – Documented code reviews, structured notes, and stakeholder-style updates.  
- **Computing Solutions** – Secure login, encryption, schema evolution, and modular services.  
- **Algorithmic Thinking** – Input validation, short-circuit logic, constant-time comparisons.  
- **Software Engineering** – Refactored structure, modular utilities, single-responsibility functions.  
- **Databases** – Extended schemas, CRUD integration, atomic operations, indexes.  
- **Security Mindset** – Hashing, encryption, whitelisting, least-privilege DB updates.
